This game is written in JAVASCRIPT, meant to emulate Rock-Paper-Scissors.

edit:
-Now runs the game using DOM manipulation to use buttons on the 
site to give a score

2/21/21 Edit:
Changed image location so that it runs independently from web hosted images. Instead of pictures not showing up, they will now appear properly.
